# NYC Schools Healthcheck Automation

#### Making submitting your daily health check at school easy.

Submitting the same Covid-19 health check form every day at school became an annoying, repetitive task.
This application uses Next.js, Typescript, and TailwindCSS to automonously submit the form at https://healthscreening.schools.nyc/ using [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios). 

It is hosted now using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) at https://healthcheck-lac.vercel.app/.
